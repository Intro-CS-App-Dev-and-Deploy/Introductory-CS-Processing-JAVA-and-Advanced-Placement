# To Include

Counting, arithmetic, operators, assignment operators, and the difference between manipulating a variable and assignment
- Similar to arithmetically changing variables, testing these, then drawing the object based on the results
- Counting summarized into Ranges and Central Tendency (mean, median, mode where applicable)

Print, Println, and Character Escapes to track variables and execution progress
- Concatenation Topics
- Note: CS20 specifically concatenates API Calls to JSON for unwrapping and populating

Strongly and loosely formatted languages, JAVA is strongly formatted and requires casting

Various Primitive Variables, Local & Global Variables
- Various ways to initiate, declare, and populate
- Connection to ASCII Values & various keyboards, etc.
- GOAL: using display geometry and orientation to populate visual object ratios for execution on any screen size and orientation

Processing-JAVA type variables like color
Applying color to RGB or hexadecimal population
Apply RGB to Night Mode Concepts without blue light

Static and Dynamic Programs
"Boilerplate of Processing-JAVA": Folder, Main Program, setup(), draw() as compiler required
keyPressed() & mousePressed() as minimum Main-Driver interactive procedures ("listeners") that interact with draw()

Display Geometry, Display Orientation, Smaller and Larger geometry statements for landscape, portrait, and square
Using single line if's to introduce Booleans and logical operators
Purpose: break the app and provide feedback to user
Long-term Goal: develop algorithm of display geometry where algorithm saves the user while providing feedback (app still works)

How single line IFs can be summarized into IF-Else and other types of IF Statements
- Note: CS20 compares conditionals of FOR vs. WHILE
- Note: CS30 compares adds FOR-Each

How drawing rectangles leads to laying out divisions of an Android App
These divisions are used to automatically size text, automatically develop aspect ratio of images (independent geometry), and other 2D shapes

Using the key board to test button code, then incorporate it into a button (unison of rect() division, draw(), mouseX&Y, and mousePressed)
- Identify Microsoft's OS requirement of clicking on the window before user interactions work with it and provide feedback to the user

Introduce grouping and naming blocks of code into Subprograms for developer reference (using TAB in Processing-JAVA)

# Ideas

if () :
if () {}
if () {} else {}
if () {} elseif () {} else
Try - Catch
Addressing on Hard-drive and printing objects
